# NL‑BIOMERO (Ubuntu/Linux) 🚀

This guide covers deploying NL‑BIOMERO on **Ubuntu/Linux**, as always tuned for FAIR imaging with BIOMERO, OMERO.forms, and other plugins.

```{warning}
This deployment guide is based on a snapshot in time development version of NL-BIOMERO. User interfaces, features, and configurations shown may have been updated and changed since this documentation was created. This content does not necessarily represent the final product and should be used as a general reference for development and demonstration purposes.
```

## 🧰 Prerequisites

- Ubuntu 18.04+ with Docker & Docker Compose  
- OpenSSH client/server  
- `chmod`, `iptables` or `ufw`  
- Let's Encrypt SSL certificates (if using HTTPS)  
- `.env` file pre-filled with your secure secrets (I'll get back to that later)

## 🔧 Key Differences from Windows Docker Desktop

### 1. PostgreSQL Image  
```yaml
image: postgres:16-alpine
```
Alpine edition works more smoothly on Debian/Ubuntu hosts.

### 2. Privileged Access Needed
Add to omero-server, worker, and web containers:

```yaml
privileged: true
# or
security_opt:
  - seccomp:unconfined
```

### 3. SSH Permissions in biomero-worker
On Linux, SSH folder is too restrictive. Before launching containers:

```bash
chmod -R 777 ~/.ssh
docker compose up -d --build
chmod -R 700 ~/.ssh
```
You could add this into a bash script so you don't forget. Or just keep the .ssh folder open (but then you can't use it manually from the host). Btw, you could move that folder to /opt/omero or something, it doesn't need to be your user's home folder .ssh.

### 4. Containerized Slurm Build
**Note**: this is only about the "fake" Slurm <a href="https://github.com/Cellular-Imaging-Amsterdam-UMC/NL-BIOMERO-Local-Slurm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NL-BIOMERO-Local-Slurm</a>. If you connect to an actual HPC you won't have these issues of course. You will have other issues probably ;)

Slurm doesn't build cleanly on Ubuntu. Build on Windows or CI, push to Docker Hub, then use, e.g.:

```yaml
services:
  slurm-worker:
    image: cellularimagingcf/slurm-docker-cluster-base:latest
```
```yaml
services:
  slurmctld:
    image: cellularimagingcf/slurm-docker-cluster-slurmctld:latest
```
In short: use <a href="https://github.com/Cellular-Imaging-Amsterdam-UMC/NL-BIOMERO-Local-Slurm/blob/master/docker-compose-from-dockerhub.yml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`docker-compose-from-dockerhub.yml`</a> for deployment for local Slurm.

### 5. Host Networking (host.docker.internal Replacement)
**Note**: this is only about the "fake" Slurm <a href="https://github.com/Cellular-Imaging-Amsterdam-UMC/NL-BIOMERO-Local-Slurm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NL-BIOMERO-Local-Slurm</a>. If you connect to an actual HPC you won't have these issues of course. You will have other issues probably ;)

Ubuntu doesn't support `host.docker.internal`. Use Docker's gateway IP (e.g. `172.17.0.1`). Also:

```bash
sudo ufw allow 2222/tcp
```
and forward that port for Slurm SSH. Then your `biomeroworker` can SSH into your `slurmctld` via the host.

### 6. Volume Permission Fixes
"Permission denied" is common for mounts on Linux. Fix interactively on the host side:

```bash
chmod -R ...
```

Paths needing attention:
- Shared data volumes (e.g. L-Drive in the `web` folder)
- `slurm-config.ini` (in the `web` folder)
- SSH dir for `10-mount-ssh.sh` (`biomeroworker` startup)

Sometimes you might have permission issues inside a container;

```bash
docker-compose exec <container> bash
chmod ...
```

But, that is gone if you restart, so consider setting permissions in Dockerfiles if stable. (e.g. by making a GitHub issue about it). I have updated a few docker images for this purpose recently.

### 7. Secrets & Metabase Setup
Populate `.env` with secure values:

```text
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=...
OMERO_ROOT_PASSWORD=...
FORMS_MASTER_PASSWORD=...
METABASE_USER=...
METABASE_PASSWORD=...
METABASE_SECRET_KEY=...
```

⚠️ `.env` is committed in the repo—override before first run. *And don't commit those changes ;)*

For Metabase:
1. Log in to `localhost:3000` with default credentials
2. Go to (admin) settings to reset your password and to the database embed settigns for a new secret key
3. Update `.env` and redeploy

### 8. HTTPS via Nginx Reverse Proxy
To get SSL / HTTPS, you need to add a reverse proxy server like NGINX to reroute your server's traffic and check against SSL certificates.

You could add this nginx service in Docker Compose:

```yaml
nginx:
  image: nginx:alpine
  networks:
    - omero
  ports:
    - "4080:4080"  # OMERO HTTP
    - "4443:4443"  # OMERO HTTPS
    - "3000:3000"  # Metabase HTTP
    - "3443:3443"  # Metabase HTTPS
  volumes:
    - ./nginx/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro
    - /etc/letsencrypt/:/etc/letsencrypt:ro
```

🔐 Don't expose OMERO or Metabase ports directly—route traffic through nginx.

This is an alternative to directly forwarding the 4080 and 3000 ports from the OMERO.web/Metabase services to your host system. Adapt the `nginx.conf` to fit your scenario (like the server url). *Hint: you can forward ports 80 and 443 to 4080 and 4443 on your host to catch all normal http(s) traffic to your server URL.*

### 9. Persistent Logs
You probably want persistent logfiles. 

Add volume mounts for logs to map them to your host system:

```yaml
services:
  omero-web:
    volumes:
      - ./logs/omero-web:/opt/omero/web/OMERO.web/var/log
```

This removes the need for `docker-compose exec ...` to read logs, and keeps historic logs around after you redeploy the container.

## ✅ Quick Start (Ubuntu)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Cellular-Imaging-Amsterdam-UMC/NL-BIOMERO.git /opt/omero/NL-BIOMERO

# Prepare .env with secure values
nano /opt/omero/.env

# Setup SSL
# Ensure you have SSL certs first at /etc/letsencrypt/
nano /opt/omero/nginx/nginx.conf

# Setup SSH
mkdir /opt/omero/.ssh
cp /opt/omero/ssh.config.ubuntu.example /opt/omero/.ssh/config
touch /opt/omero/.ssh/known_hosts
# Copy, or make, SSH keys to that same folder
# e.g. ssh-keygen -t rsa

# Setup some permissions
chmod -R 777 /opt/omero/.ssh
chmod -R 777 /opt/omero/NL-BIOMERO/web/L-Drive
chmod -R 777 /opt/omero/NL-BIOMERO/web/slurm-config.ini

docker-compose -f /opt/omero/docker-compose-for-ubuntu-with-SSL.yml up -d --build
docker-compose -f /opt/omero/docker-compose-for-ubuntu-with-SSL.yml logs -f

# Change metabase secrets at :3000 / :3443 and update .env
# restart 
docker-compose -f /opt/omero/docker-compose-for-ubuntu-with-SSL.yml down
docker-compose -f /opt/omero/docker-compose-for-ubuntu-with-SSL.yml up -d --build
```

👉 Ensure your firewall allows ports: **4080**, **4443**, **3000**, **3443**, and **2222**.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Tips

| Symptom | Resolution |
|---------|------------|
| "Permission denied" (SSH) | Use `chmod -R 777 ~/.ssh` before booting |
| Web login/password issues | Make sure `.env` is set, and handle Metabase first-login flow |
| Slurm SSH failure | Verify Docker gateway IP and open port 2222 |
| SSL certificate issues | Confirm cert paths and reload nginx |

---

## 🧠 Lessons Learned

- **Permissions make or break Linux deployments**—pre-fix if possible
- `host.docker.internal` is unavailable: use dynamic gateway IP
- **Slurm is brittle**—better to pre-build and host container images
- **Nginx proxy handles HTTPS**, hides internal ports
- **Probably mount logs**—no more chasing with `exec` & `tail`

---

## 📋 TL;DR

- Use `postgres:16-alpine`
- Add `privileged`/`unconfined` seccomp
- `chmod 777` SSH and writable mounts
- Deploy Slurm via pre-built images
- Use Docker gateway IP and open 2222
- Manage secrets via `.env`, treat Metabase manually
- Layer nginx proxy & mount SSL directories
- Persist logs via volume mounts
